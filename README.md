# SAP 1 CPU
## This is a project of an CPU emulator based on SAP_1 (Simple as Possible)

* The SAP 1 is a basic CPU model, that can make operations like addition and subtraction, this CPU is the first step to make a real Turing completeness;
---
### Features of this project:
* **SAP 1** emulator
* **Assembler** for this architecture
---
### Comming soon:
* **SAP 2**  (already turring completeness);
* **SAP 3**;
* Better Assembler for all this architectures;
* Refactoring to emulate in **C++**;
* 100% functional emulator of microprocessor **MOS 6502**;
  * The 6502 chip was used in many products in the 1970s, such as the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, and of course the Apple II. By emulating this processor, I will be able to create emulators of all the items mentioned
